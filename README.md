## Installation/Viewing the Files

Download the files contained in the Homework-8 repository, either through Github or by making a clone of the repository and downloading it locally. Once downloaded, open the file index.html to view the webpage. The published site can be found here: https://mcnaryj.github.io/McNary-Homework-8/.

## Acceptance Criteria
(Taken from the initial readme)
1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

## Notes

This was a good one to refresh on everything. I was able to remove a ton of code that was not doing anything, and clean up the content so it was less buggy/ugly to look at. Obviously I could have done more with this, but I was focused on completing the main tasks, and I prefer a dryer-style of presentation for my resume as it is, so I'm going to keep with that theme here.

## Contributing
I will be providing the url for the site via the GitHub repository, and it can also be found here: https://mcnaryj.github.io/Homework-8/ however any pull requests are welcome.
